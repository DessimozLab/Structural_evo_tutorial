    "# Protein Structure Homology and Evolutionary Analysis with Foldseek\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome! In this notebook, you will explore protein structure homology and evolutionary relationships using the Foldseek API. You can use your own protein structure or select one from the AlphaFold Database, identify homologous structures, and analyze their relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "- **Select a protein structure:** Use your own data or choose a structure from the AlphaFold DB.\n",
    "- **Find homologs:** Query the Foldseek API to identify structurally similar proteins.\n",
    "- **Download structures:** Retrieve the 3D structures of homologous proteins.\n",
    "- **Compare structures:** Perform structural alignments and analyze similarities.\n",
    "- **Build a phylogeny:** Derive a phylogenetic tree based on structural relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow Overview\n",
    "1. Choose a protein structure\n",
    "2. Search for homologs with Foldseek\n",
    "3. Download homologous structures\n",
    "4. Structural comparison\n",
    "5. Phylogenetic analysis\n",
